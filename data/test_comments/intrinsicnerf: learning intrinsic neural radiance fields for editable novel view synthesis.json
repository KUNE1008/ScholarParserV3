Supplementary Material In this section, we provide further details on the experiments and datasets, followed by additional ablation studies and experimental results. More Details on Experiments Experimental Details Comparisons on Phototourism F3.A subset for fewshot view synthesis was created by selecting 3 input views with similar depth bounds and frontal-facing poses. The image IDs are (185, 45, 1066), (964, 34, 478), and (82, 312, 803) for \u2018Brandenburg Gate\u2019, \u2018Sacre Coeur\u2019, and \u2018Trevi Fountain\u2019, respectively. Fig. 7 shows image samples of the dataset. Each scene has about eight test images to evaluate the performance. For the depth map comparison using Abs Rel, the original ground truth depth maps provided by Phototourism (Snavely, Seitz, and Szeliski 2006) are very noisy. Following the publicly available instructions of the dataset, we used the clean versions of the depth maps with the background masks. As a result, reported Abs Rel excludes background regions for the evaluation. More detailed information about the proposed datasets can be found in the next section. Comparisons on NeRF Extreme. For evaluating the fewshot view synthesis performance on NeRF Extreme, image IDs (0, 14, 29) were used as inputs for each scene. Given that our proposed multi-view consistency takes into account complex scene geometry, including occlusions, the optimal model and parameters might vary based on the specific scene characteristics. However, experimental results in Tab. 4of the paper were based on our final model. Ablation studies. In this paragraph, we provide detailed information about the ablation studies, especially for ablation 1-3, with albedo MLP. Ablations other than 1-3, were conducted with straightforward implementation with and without proposed consistency regularization. In the case of 1-3, we implemented the multi-view albedo consistency by directly synthesizing the albedo map using the Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) of NeRF. Given the viewindependent nature of albedo, we configured the MLP to output albedo as density. By doing so, the proposed framework may be free from the computational costs that come from continuous patch-wise sampling. However, as shown in Tab. 5 in the paper, the model with albedo MLP shows sub-optimal results, which has almost the same results as the model without albedo consistency (1-1). Implementation Details Neural radiance fields. Our framework is based on JAX (Bradbury et al. 2018) implementation of RegNeRF (Niemeyer et al. 2022), while partially adopting a frequency regularization mask of FreeNeRF (Yang, Pavone, and Wang 2023) when constructing MLP. Detailed algorithms of the proposed loss functions are provided in Alg. 1 and 2. Figure 7: Examples of inputs sampled from Phototourism F3.Sampled frontal-facing scenes with varying illumination from the \u2018Brandenburg Gate\u2019, \u2018Sacre Coeur\u2019, and \u2018Trevi Fountain\u2019, respectively. Intrinsic decomposition network. Building upon the concept of integrating an offline intrinsic decomposition network, our PIDNet adopts the architecture of the chosen FIDNet. Given that our ultimate model employs IIDWW (Li and Snavely 2018) as the FIDNet to provide pseudo-albedo ground truth, our PIDNet shares a similar architecture with IIDWW, albeit in a shallower configuration. However, it\u2019s worth highlighting that any intrinsic decomposition network demonstrating superior performance can substitute IIDWW as the FIDNet with a paired PIDNet that has a similar, and shallower architecture. Additional Losses In addition to the losses suggested in the main paper, we incorporates several losses to better optimize the PIDNet as described below. For Lcolor andLds, they were part of the baseline and showed a performance decrease upon removal. Edge-preserving loss. Motivated by (Godard, Mac Aodha, and Brostow 2017), we used the gradient-based edge-preserving loss, to enforce the input and the novel view patches to preserve geometric properties. Using a weight term, \u03c9(x), which already has been discussed in the paper, our edge-preserving loss on the predicted albedo can be formulated as: Ledge=X x\u2032\u2208P\u2032\u03c9(x)\u2225\u2202(\u02c6a(x)\u2212\u02c6a(x\u2032))\u22252,(12) where \u2202denotes the partial derivatives of the vertical and the horizontal directions, and P\u2032denotes all the pixels in the target image. Chromaticity consistency loss. Similar to (Ye et al.",
